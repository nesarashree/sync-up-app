# SyncUp: Match, Study, Repeat
*CS 278 Final Project*

Stanford students often face an invisible challenge: studying alone. While group work and social learning are known to boost academic outcomes, the tools for forming academic partnerships are nonexistent. SyncUp is a sociotechnical system designed to fill this gap, helping students find study partners, amass a peer network, and stay accountable through lightweight, intentional connections. 

Our target audience is students seeking structure and motivation, particularly around major deadlines like finals or midterms. SyncUp combines a swipe-based discovery model (inspired by Tinder, our piggyback prototype) with features tuned for academic contexts and norms that promote reciprocity.

### Paper — Sociotechnical Design 
Examining the sociotechnical concepts driving SyncUp, our final paper discusses how our design choices facilitate meaningful academic connections. We analyze pilot data demonstrating how group features lowered barriers to meetups and increased engagement. We also outline future directions for scaling, intelligent matching, and privacy considerations.
