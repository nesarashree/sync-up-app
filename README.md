# SyncUp: Match, Study, Repeat
*CS 278 Final Project*

Stanford students often face an invisible challenge: studying alone. While group work and social learning are known to boost academic outcomes, the tools for forming academic partnerships are nonexistent. SyncUp is a sociotechnical system designed to fill this gapâ€”helping students find study partners, amass a peer network, and stay accountable through lightweight, intentional connections.

Our target audience is students seeking structure and motivation, particularly around major deadlines like finals or midterms. SyncUp combines a swipe-based discovery model (inspired by Tinder, our piggyback prototype) with features tuned for academic contexts: profile-based matching, scheduling, messaging, and norms that promote reciprocity and reliability.

During our pilot, we found that purely one-on-one matches often felt too high-stakes for new users. By introducing a simple group-study feature, we unlocked significantly higher engagement and follow-through on real-world meetups. This showed that facilitating low-pressure, socially reinforced connections can make academic accountability both more approachable and more effective.
